# PubScore
[This website](https://pubscore.herokuapp.com/) was created to keep track of the teamscores in a Pubquiz competition.<br>
As competing team you can see how your team is doing in the competition.<br>
As Admin you can add teams to the competiton and update there scores after each pubquiz.<br>
## UX
* User stories
    * Competing Team Goals
        1. As a competing team, I want to be able to see if the scores have been updates after the last pubquiz.
        2. As a competing team, I want to be able to see how our team is doing in the ranking.
        3. As a competing team, I want to be able to leave the competition.
    * Administrator Goals
        1. As the admin, I want to be able to add teams to the competition.
        2. As the admin, I want to be able to update the score for each team.
        3. As the admin, I want to be able to see for which team I have updated the scores to prevent mistakes.
        4. As the admin, I want to be able to substract points in case a mistake does happen.
        5. As the admin, I want to be able to delete a team from the competition in case a team requests this.
        6. As the admin, I want to get a warning before a team is deleted.
        7. As the admin, I want to be able to contact the owner of the site in case of any problems.
        8. As the admin, I don't want other people to be able to use pages from where changes to the database can be made.
* Design
    * Color Scheme
        * Because it is a site for a pubquiz competition, I've used typical beer colors.
    * Typography
        * For the PubScore logo I used the font "Do Hyeon" because it reminds me of a typical Highscore look.
        For the rest of the website I've used the font "Titillium Web" because I think it fits well with "Do Hyeon" and it's easy to read.
    * Imagery
        * The images on this page would come from the competing teams through a url link.
        In case there is no team image, I've created a default images that fits well with the rest of the website.
* Wireframes
